Answer a question using the following story:

> Stereotypical Barbie ("Barbie") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models, who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctor, lawyer, and politician. Beach Ken ("Ken") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and seeks a closer relationship, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.
>
> One evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her usual routines the next day. She seeks out Weird Barbie, a disfigured doll, who tells her she must find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Ken stows away in her convertible to join her, to which Barbie reluctantly agrees.
>
> Arriving at Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man for groping her, leading to her and Ken's brief arrest. Alarmed by their presence, Mattel's CEO orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a teenage girl named Sasha, who criticizes her for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha's mother, inadvertently caused her existential crisis after Gloria began playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys in a similar state. Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help and the three travel to Barbieland with Mattel executives in pursuit.
>
> Meanwhile, Ken learns about patriarchy and feels respected for the first time. Returning to Barbieland, he persuades the other Kens to take over, and the Barbies are indoctrinated into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and fails to convince everyone to return to the way things were. She becomes depressed, but Gloria gives her a speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, restoring Barbie's self-confidence.
>
> With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria's speech deprograms the Barbies from their indoctrination. They then manipulate the Kens into fighting amongst themselves, distracting them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, and the Barbies regain power. Having now experienced systemic oppression for themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and all outcasts.
>
> Barbie and Ken apologize to each other, acknowledging their mistakes. Ken bemoans his lack of purpose without Barbie, so she encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots.
>
> Barbie decides to become human and return to the real world, and is bidden goodbye by the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name "Barbara Handler", to her first gynecologist appointment.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Stereotypical Barbie ("Barbie") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models, who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctor, lawyer, and politician. Beach Ken ("Ken") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and seeks a closer relationship, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.
>
> One evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her usual routines the next day. She seeks out Weird Barbie, a disfigured doll, who tells her she must find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Ken stows away in her convertible to join her, to which Barbie reluctantly agrees.
>
> Arriving at Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man for groping her, leading to her and Ken's brief arrest. Alarmed by their presence, Mattel's CEO orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a teenage girl named Sasha, who criticizes her for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha's mother, inadvertently caused her existential crisis after Gloria began playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys in a similar state. Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help and the three travel to Barbieland with Mattel executives in pursuit.
>
> Meanwhile, Ken learns about patriarchy and feels respected for the first time. Returning to Barbieland, he persuades the other Kens to take over, and the Barbies are indoctrinated into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and fails to convince everyone to return to the way things were. She becomes depressed, but Gloria gives her a speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, restoring Barbie's self-confidence.
>
> With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria's speech deprograms the Barbies from their indoctrination. They then manipulate the Kens into fighting amongst themselves, distracting them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, and the Barbies regain power. Having now experienced systemic oppression for themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and all outcasts.
>
> Barbie and Ken apologize to each other, acknowledging their mistakes. Ken bemoans his lack of purpose without Barbie, so she encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots.
>
> Barbie decides to become human and return to the real world, and is bidden goodbye by the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name "Barbara Handler", to her first gynecologist appointment.

Answer a question using the following story:

> In 1945, near the end of World War II, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima feigns technical issues with his plane and lands on Odo Island. Lead mechanic Tachibana implies that Shikishima fled from his duty. That night, a dinosaur-like creature, Godzilla, attacks. Shikishima gets in his plane but cannot bring himself to shoot the monster and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up to learn that Tachibana is the only other survivor, who blames Shikishima for failing to act.
>
> In 1946, Shikishima returns home to find his parents were killed in the bombing of Tokyo. Plagued by survivor's guilt, he works as a minesweeper and begins supporting a woman, Noriko Ōishi, whose parents also died in the bombing, and an orphaned baby, Akiko, whom Noriko rescued.
>
> Later that year, Godzilla is mutated and enlarged by the United States' nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll; it destroys several U.S. warships before heading for Japan. The U.S. refuses help, owing to tensions with the Soviet Union, but General Douglas MacArthur sends decommissioned Imperial Japanese Navy vessels.
>
> In May 1947, Shikishima and his minesweeper crew are tasked with stopping Godzilla's approach to Japan, in reality stalling for time for larger vessels to arrive. They release a mine into Godzilla's mouth and detonate it, doing significant damage, but it quickly regenerates. The heavy cruiser Takao then arrives and engages Godzilla, but is subsequently destroyed when Godzilla unleashes its atomic "heat ray."
>
> After returning to Tokyo, Shikishima tells Noriko about the attack and his earlier encounter with Godzilla. Days later, Godzilla makes landfall in Japan, attacking Ginza, where Noriko works. Noriko narrowly avoids dying and is found by Shikishima. Type 4 Chi-To medium tanks engage Godzilla, but it fires its heat ray which causes a nuclear explosion that obliterates Ginza, killing tens of thousands. Noriko pushes Shikishima into an alley but is caught in the blast herself and presumed dead. Devastated by the loss of Noriko, Shikishima vows revenge against Godzilla.
>
> Godzilla departs, but is expected to return; the government refuses to do more to prevent another attack. One of the minesweeper's crew, former Naval engineer Kenji Noda plans to destroy Godzilla by surrounding it with Freon tanks and rupturing them, lowering the water's buoyancy and sinking it to a depth of 1,500 meters, letting the resultant pressure crush it. Should that plan fail, balloons will be inflated under Godzilla to force it back up to the surface, killing it through explosive decompression. He has recruited private citizens, mostly former Naval members, to enact his plan. Shikishima recruits Tachibana, the mechanic he fought alongside, to repair a broken-down Kyushu J7W Shinden fighter. Shikishima plans to fly into Godzilla's mouth, then detonate an explosive charge inside the plane in an attempt to destroy the monster from the inside. He leaves Akiko in the care of his neighbor Sumiko.
>
> Godzilla resurfaces, and Shikishima draws it into the trap. After Godzilla is tricked into destroying two unmanned destroyers with its heat ray, the two remaining ships get close and wrap it in the buoys. Godzilla is then successfully dragged down to 1,500 meters but survives. The balloons are activated, forcing Godzilla up to 800 meters, but it survives and manages to break free. Two ships try to haul Godzilla to the surface but fail. A fleet of tugboats lend their assistance and Godzilla is brought to the surface. Still alive and enraged, Godzilla prepares to destroy all the ships with its heat ray. Shikishima flies the explosive plane into Godzilla's mouth and remembers Tachibana imploring him to use the ejection seat, to let go of his survivor's guilt and choose to live. The plane explodes, destroying Godzilla's head and causing the energy of its heat ray to tear its body apart. The crew celebrates as Shikishima parachutes down, having chosen to live.
>
> Shikishima receives a telegram and heads to the hospital with Akiko. They are reunited with Noriko, who survived the destruction, but has a black mark creeping up her neck. Meanwhile, a chunk of Godzilla's flesh sinks into the ocean and begins to regenerate.

Answer a question using the following story:

> In 1945, near the end of World War II, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima feigns technical issues with his plane and lands on Odo Island. Lead mechanic Tachibana implies that Shikishima fled from his duty. That night, a dinosaur-like creature, Godzilla, attacks. Shikishima gets in his plane but cannot bring himself to shoot the monster and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up to learn that Tachibana is the only other survivor, who blames Shikishima for failing to act.

> In 1946, Shikishima returns home to find his parents were killed in the bombing of Tokyo. Plagued by survivor's guilt, he works as a minesweeper and begins supporting a woman, Noriko Ōishi, whose parents also died in the bombing, and an orphaned baby, Akiko, whom Noriko rescued.

> Later that year, Godzilla is mutated and enlarged by the United States' nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll; it destroys several U.S. warships before heading for Japan. The U.S. refuses help, owing to tensions with the Soviet Union, but General Douglas MacArthur sends decommissioned Imperial Japanese Navy vessels.

Question: How does Godzilla cause nuclear explosions?
Answer: Godzilla causes nuclear explosions using his "heat ray".

Answer a question using the following story:

> In 1945, near the end of World War II, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima feigns technical issues with his plane and lands on Odo Island. Lead mechanic Tachibana implies that Shikishima fled from his duty. That night, a dinosaur-like creature, Godzilla, attacks. Shikishima gets in his plane but cannot bring himself to shoot the monster and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up to learn that Tachibana is the only other survivor, who blames Shikishima for failing to act.
>
> In 1946, Shikishima returns home to find his parents were killed in the bombing of Tokyo. Plagued by survivor's guilt, he works as a minesweeper and begins supporting a woman, Noriko Ōishi, whose parents also died in the bombing, and an orphaned baby, Akiko, whom Noriko rescued.
>
> Later that year, Godzilla is mutated and enlarged by the United States' nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll; it destroys several U.S. warships before heading for Japan. The U.S. refuses help, owing to tensions with the Soviet Union, but General Douglas MacArthur sends decommissioned Imperial Japanese Navy vessels.
>
> In May 1947, Shikishima and his minesweeper crew are tasked with stopping Godzilla's approach to Japan, in reality stalling for time for larger vessels to arrive. They release a mine into Godzilla's mouth and detonate it, doing significant damage, but it quickly regenerates. The heavy cruiser Takao then arrives and engages Godzilla, but is subsequently destroyed when Godzilla unleashes its atomic "heat ray."
>
> After returning to Tokyo, Shikishima tells Noriko about the attack and his earlier encounter with Godzilla. Days later, Godzilla makes landfall in Japan, attacking Ginza, where Noriko works. Noriko narrowly avoids dying and is found by Shikishima. Type 4 Chi-To medium tanks engage Godzilla, but it fires its heat ray which causes a nuclear explosion that obliterates Ginza, killing tens of thousands. Noriko pushes Shikishima into an alley but is caught in the blast herself and presumed dead. Devastated by the loss of Noriko, Shikishima vows revenge against Godzilla.
>
> Godzilla departs, but is expected to return; the government refuses to do more to prevent another attack. One of the minesweeper's crew, former Naval engineer Kenji Noda plans to destroy Godzilla by surrounding it with Freon tanks and rupturing them, lowering the water's buoyancy and sinking it to a depth of 1,500 meters, letting the resultant pressure crush it. Should that plan fail, balloons will be inflated under Godzilla to force it back up to the surface, killing it through explosive decompression. He has recruited private citizens, mostly former Naval members, to enact his plan. Shikishima recruits Tachibana, the mechanic he fought alongside, to repair a broken-down Kyushu J7W Shinden fighter. Shikishima plans to fly into Godzilla's mouth, then detonate an explosive charge inside the plane in an attempt to destroy the monster from the inside. He leaves Akiko in the care of his neighbor Sumiko.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Dee asks Dennis for money, despite not working through the day. When the Gang questions her about her motives, she finally reveals that she is going out bowling with some friends of hers. After she leaves, the rest of the Gang declares they would not waste their time going bowling.
>
> At the bowling alley, Dee meets with her team, which consists of The Waitress, Artemis, and Gail the Snail. They did not want Dee on their team, but their fourth required member dropped out. Suddenly, Charlie, Dennis, Mac, and Frank arrive, intending to fend off the girls in a girls vs boys league. They visit the alley owners, which are revealed to be Liam and Ryan McPoyle, who bought the place after a financial turmoil. After paying a fee, they allow them to play in the league.
>
> The first round starts with the boys all achieving strikes, while the girls struggle in competing. After Dennis mocks the girls, Dee decides to employ a new strategy, which will involve manipulating the boys for their stupidity. This gets them to almost match their score in the following rounds. When Dennis mocks Dee again, The Waitress challenges him to an arcade game to prove his test of strength by punching a ball. The Waitress delivers a kick that gives her points, but Dennis' punch hits the limit of the score, earning him the win. However, the punch was strong enough to break his bones and cannot bowl on the final game against Dee. He convinces Liam to bowl for him, while Dee gets Ryan to bowl for her team. During his turn, Liam cannot see the pins due to his blurred vision and accidentally hits Ryan's hand with a ball, causing both to drop out and Dennis and Dee having to play. Dee finally overcomes her mockery and manages to strike one pin, winning. However, she notes that everyone left and The Waitress admits she is not interested in their win as she doesn't care about women's sports.

After Dennis mocks the girls, Dee decides to employ a new strategy, which will involve manipulating the boys for their stupidity. This gets them to almost match their score in the following rounds. When Dennis mocks Dee again, The Waitress challenges him to an arcade game to prove his test of strength by punching a ball. The Waitress delivers a kick that gives her points, but Dennis' punch hits the limit of the score, earning him the win. However, the punch was strong enough to break his bones and cannot bowl on the final game against Dee. He convinces Liam to bowl for him, while Dee gets Ryan to bowl for her team. During his turn, Liam cannot see the pins due to his blurred vision and accidentally hits Ryan's hand with a ball, causing both to drop out and Dennis and Dee having to play. Dee finally overcomes her mockery and manages to strike one pin, winning. However, she notes that everyone left and The Waitress admits she is not interested in their win as she doesn't care about women's sports.

Answer a question using the following story:

> After Loki was sent through a time door by Sylvie at the Citadel at the End of Time, he is returned to the Time Variance Authority (TVA) headquarters, where he starts uncontrollably warping across time at the same location. Loki initially arrives in the past, where TVA employees do not know him and attempt to apprehend him. Later in the past, Loki discovers a recording of the TVA's creator, He Who Remains, praising the TVA's Ravonna Renslayer for working with him.
>
> In the present, the TVA is in disarray due to the rapid branching of the Sacred Timeline, caused by Sylvie's killing of He Who Remains. Renslayer's absence leads to Judge Gamble and General Dox assuming leadership positions. Hunter B-15 and Mobius convince Gamble and Dox that TVA employees are all variants taken from branched timelines; Gamble is persuaded to order the TVA to stop eliminating branched timelines. Loki warps into the meeting and exposes He Who Remains' role as the mastermind behind the TVA. Loki warns Mobius of the threat of the many variants of He Who Remains. Dox has many TVA hunters heavily arm themselves for a supposed mission to find Sylvie.
>
> To stop Loki's warping, Loki and Mobius meet TVA technician Ouroboros, who has been working alone for centuries. Ouroboros deduces that Loki is "time slipping", suggesting that it is caused by the timeline branches dangerously overloading the TVA's Temporal Loom. Ouroboros instructs Mobius to approach the Temporal Loom with the Temporal Aura Extractor device to extract Loki from the time stream as Loki "prunes" himself, which would release him from time.
>
> Loki time slips to the future, where the TVA is being evacuated as the Loom goes critical. He tries to find a Timestick to prune himself, briefly encounters Sylvie, and is pruned from behind by someone at the last possible second. In the present, Ouroboros starts sealing off the Temporal Loom to protect the TVA, despite Mobius' protests to wait for Loki. Mobius successfully pulls Loki from the time stream, and the two tumble back into safety from the Temporal Loom, which becomes sealed off. Loki and Mobius set out to find Sylvie.
>
> In a mid-credit scene, Sylvie enters a branched timeline in Broxton, Oklahoma in 1982, and visits a McDonald's restaurant.

> After Loki was sent through a time door by Sylvie at the Citadel at the End of Time, he is returned to the Time Variance Authority (TVA) headquarters, where he starts uncontrollably warping across time at the same location. Loki initially arrives in the past, where TVA employees do not know him and attempt to apprehend him. Later in the past, Loki discovers a recording of the TVA's creator, He Who Remains, praising the TVA's Ravonna Renslayer for working with him.
>
> In the present, the TVA is in disarray due to the rapid branching of the Sacred Timeline, caused by Sylvie's killing of He Who Remains. Renslayer's absence leads to Judge Gamble and General Dox assuming leadership positions. Hunter B-15 and Mobius convince Gamble and Dox that TVA employees are all variants taken from branched timelines; Gamble is persuaded to order the TVA to stop eliminating branched timelines. Loki warps into the meeting and exposes He Who Remains' role as the mastermind behind the TVA. Loki warns Mobius of the threat of the many variants of He Who Remains. Dox has many TVA hunters heavily arm themselves for a supposed mission to find Sylvie.
>
> To stop Loki's warping, Loki and Mobius meet TVA technician Ouroboros, who has been working alone for centuries. Ouroboros deduces that Loki is "time slipping", suggesting that it is caused by the timeline branches dangerously overloading the TVA's Temporal Loom. Ouroboros instructs Mobius to approach the Temporal Loom with the Temporal Aura Extractor device to extract Loki from the time stream as Loki "prunes" himself, which would release him from time.
>
> Loki time slips to the future, where the TVA is being evacuated as the Loom goes critical. He tries to find a Timestick to prune himself, briefly encounters Sylvie, and is pruned from behind by someone at the last possible second. In the present, Ouroboros starts sealing off the Temporal Loom to protect the TVA, despite Mobius' protests to wait for Loki. Mobius successfully pulls Loki from the time stream, and the two tumble back into safety from the Temporal Loom, which becomes sealed off. Loki and Mobius set out to find Sylvie.
>
> In a mid-credit scene, Sylvie enters a branched timeline in Broxton, Oklahoma in 1982, and visits a McDonald's restaurant.

Answer a question using the following story:

> A next-generation Russian submarine Sevastopol employs an advanced AI, activated by a two-pieced cruciform key. The AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to retrieve one-half of the key from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, who carries a bounty from an unknown source. Ethan retrieves the half-key and fakes Ilsa's death. Back in Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger to discuss the rogue AI. Director Eugene Kittridge recounts how the "Entity" has achieved sentience and can manipulate major defense intelligence and financial networks of the world at will. World powers compete to obtain the key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.
>
> Revealing himself and exposing Kittridge's bounty on Ilsa, Ethan states his intention to destroy the Entity. Ethan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other half-key despite knowing they will be racing against all world powers. Ethan evades US agents in pursuit of the holder, but the half-key is stolen by a professional thief named Grace. Concurrently, Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device. Ethan suspects foul play after seeing Gabriel, a sadistic Entity liaison with ties to Ethan's pre-IMF past. Aborting the mission, the team scatters and Grace escapes to Rome. Grace is apprehended upon arrival, where she is rescued by Ethan from local authorities, US Agents and an Entity operative named Paris. Grace again escapes, but Ethan rendezvous with Luther and Benji and Ilsa rejoins them. With Benji and Luther providing support, Ethan and Ilsa follow Grace to Venice where they infiltrate a party held by the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis.
>
> With the party masquerading as a brokerage set up by the Entity, all groups disclose their role in acquiring the complete key. Grace had been hired by Alanna to steal one half to combine with the other, which will be sold to her buyer the next day on the Orient Express. Through the Entity, Gabriel proclaims that he will possess the key the following day regardless of any outcome and that it has also determined either Ilsa or Grace will die. Ethan unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale, allowing Gabriel and Grace to walk free. Ethan pursues Grace, but the Entity impersonates Benji and leads him into a fight with Paris, whom he subdues and spares. Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Ethan. A remorseful Grace agrees to impersonate Alanna and take back the key during the sale. Luther leaves for an off-grid location to investigate the traces of the Entity in his hard drive, reminding Ethan to spare Gabriel for information despite his declaration of vengeance for Ilsa's death. On the train, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. With Paris, Gabriel meets Denlinger, who divulges information only he knows in an attempt to form an alliance between himself and the Entity.
>
> Originally an advanced cyber weapon developed by the United States, the Entity "overperformed" when it infiltrated the Sevastopol and subsequently went rogue. The complete key unlocks a chamber inside the vessel which contains the Entity's source code, allowing it to be destroyed or controlled. Gabriel nevertheless kills Denlinger and attempts to kill Paris, who the Entity has determined will betray them after Ethan spared her life in Venice. Impersonating Alanna, Grace brings the key to the buyer, who is revealed to be Kittridge. She negotiates a $100 million sale and protection for herself, but after deciding against it pickpockets the key from Kittridge. Ethan parachutes onto the train to save Grace from her pursuers, but Gabriel acquires the key. Ethan battles Gabriel atop the train, but Gabriel escapes and detonates a bridge ahead. Grace and Ethan detach the locomotive from the rest of the train, saving the passengers. Paris rescues both from falling, telling Ethan the key's connection to the Sevastopol. Grace informs Kittridge of her desire to join the IMF. Ethan flees the wreckage by paraglider with the complete key, which he had taken during his fight with Gabriel, and rendezvous with Benji to continue the mission.

Answer a question using the following story:

> A next-generation Russian submarine Sevastopol employs an advanced AI, activated by a two-pieced cruciform key. The AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to retrieve one-half of the key from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, who carries a bounty from an unknown source. Ethan retrieves the half-key and fakes Ilsa's death. Back in Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger to discuss the rogue AI. Director Eugene Kittridge recounts how the "Entity" has achieved sentience and can manipulate major defense intelligence and financial networks of the world at will. World powers compete to obtain the key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.

Question: Where was the hoax nuclear device disarmed?
Answer: The hoax nuclear device disarmed at the Abu Dhabi International Airport.

Answer a question using the following story:

> A next-generation Russian submarine Sevastopol employs an advanced AI, activated by a two-pieced cruciform key. The AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to retrieve one-half of the key from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, who carries a bounty from an unknown source. Ethan retrieves the half-key and fakes Ilsa's death. Back in Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger to discuss the rogue AI. Director Eugene Kittridge recounts how the "Entity" has achieved sentience and can manipulate major defense intelligence and financial networks of the world at will. World powers compete to obtain the key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.
>
> Revealing himself and exposing Kittridge's bounty on Ilsa, Ethan states his intention to destroy the Entity. Ethan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other half-key despite knowing they will be racing against all world powers. Ethan evades US agents in pursuit of the holder, but the half-key is stolen by a professional thief named Grace. Concurrently, Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device. Ethan suspects foul play after seeing Gabriel, a sadistic Entity liaison with ties to Ethan's pre-IMF past. Aborting the mission, the team scatters and Grace escapes to Rome. Grace is apprehended upon arrival, where she is rescued by Ethan from local authorities, US Agents and an Entity operative named Paris. Grace again escapes, but Ethan rendezvous with Luther and Benji and Ilsa rejoins them. With Benji and Luther providing support, Ethan and Ilsa follow Grace to Venice where they infiltrate a party held by the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis.
>
> With the party masquerading as a brokerage set up by the Entity, all groups disclose their role in acquiring the complete key. Grace had been hired by Alanna to steal one half to combine with the other, which will be sold to her buyer the next day on the Orient Express. Through the Entity, Gabriel proclaims that he will possess the key the following day regardless of any outcome and that it has also determined either Ilsa or Grace will die. Ethan unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale, allowing Gabriel and Grace to walk free. Ethan pursues Grace, but the Entity impersonates Benji and leads him into a fight with Paris, whom he subdues and spares. Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Ethan. A remorseful Grace agrees to impersonate Alanna and take back the key during the sale. Luther leaves for an off-grid location to investigate the traces of the Entity in his hard drive, reminding Ethan to spare Gabriel for information despite his declaration of vengeance for Ilsa's death.

Answer a question using the following story:

> John Kramer is told he has only months to live due to advanced brain cancer. He attends a cancer support group meeting and befriends Henry Kessler, who later claims he has been cured by an experimental Norwegian cancer treatment conducted by a group led by Dr. Finn Pederson. A desperate John contacts the doctor's daughter Cecilia, who refers him to her clinic outside Mexico City.
>
> On arrival in Mexico, John is driven to the clinic and introduced to Cecilia and her team—Mateo, Valentina, and Dr. Cortez—as well as patients Gabriela and Parker and the caretaker's young son Carlos, with whom he bonds. John goes under for surgery and awakens to Cecilia telling him that he is now cancer-free. Finding a new lease on life, he purchases a gift for Gabriela; however, upon returning to the clinic, he finds it abandoned, a video simulating his supposed brain surgery and no scar on his head, realizing the entire operation was a scam.
>
> Deducing that "Dr. Cortez" was his taxi driver Diego in disguise, John kidnaps and interrogates him, before forcing him to play one of his "games", with pipe bombs wired into his arms, telling him to remove them by cutting through his flesh. Diego passes the test. Meanwhile, Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda Young kidnaps Cecilia, Mateo, Valentina, and Gabriela. They wake up in the clinic, now subjects of John's Jigsaw games.
>
> Valentina is tasked with severing her leg with a Gigli saw and extracting enough bone marrow to release a key to free herself. She successfully amputates her leg but is unable to collect enough marrow, and a second Gigli saw decapitates her. Cecilia uses Valentina's intestines as a rope to retrieve her phone and call for help, but Amanda shocks her into submission and confiscates the phone.
>
> Parker breaks into the clinic, demanding his money back. Amanda restrains him while Mateo is forced to drill into his own skull and remove a piece of cerebral tissue to dissolve in a test tube and obtain a key. Although he successfully performs the task, the tissue fails to dissolve in time, and a heated mask closes over his face, killing him. Next, Gabriela is suspended from shackles and subjected to ionizing radiation, tasked with freeing herself by using a sledgehammer to break her shackled limbs. She succeeds, but before Amanda can take her to a hospital, Parker forces them at gunpoint to release Cecilia.
>
> Cecilia kills Gabriela by breaking her neck and reveals she called Parker, who is part of the scam, to rescue her. She forces John to chain himself into the trap meant for her; when she hears Carlos outside, she takes the child and chains him opposite John. The trap begins to waterboard them with blood. Parker and Cecilia leave to retrieve their bag of stolen cash from John's control room but activate a tripwire, sealing them both in the room and freeing John and Carlos. John reveals Diego outed all of the scammers—including Parker and Henry—and that he tricked Cecilia into luring Parker to the facility. A deadly chemical gas begins filling the room, with the only respite a ventilation hole large enough for one person's head, forcing Cecilia and Parker to fight each other. Cecilia kills Parker but can only watch as John, Amanda, and Carlos exit the facility, leaving her trapped inside.
>
> Sometime later, Henry awakens in a dilapidated bathroom with a new trap strapped to his stomach, overseen by John and Mark Hoffman.

Answer a question using the following story:

> John Kramer is told he has only months to live due to advanced brain cancer. He attends a cancer support group meeting and befriends Henry Kessler, who later claims he has been cured by an experimental Norwegian cancer treatment conducted by a group led by Dr. Finn Pederson. A desperate John contacts the doctor's daughter Cecilia, who refers him to her clinic outside Mexico City.
>
> On arrival in Mexico, John is driven to the clinic and introduced to Cecilia and her team—Mateo, Valentina, and Dr. Cortez—as well as patients Gabriela and Parker and the caretaker's young son Carlos, with whom he bonds. John goes under for surgery and awakens to Cecilia telling him that he is now cancer-free. Finding a new lease on life, he purchases a gift for Gabriela; however, upon returning to the clinic, he finds it abandoned, a video simulating his supposed brain surgery and no scar on his head, realizing the entire operation was a scam.
>
> Deducing that "Dr. Cortez" was his taxi driver Diego in disguise, John kidnaps and interrogates him, before forcing him to play one of his "games", with pipe bombs wired into his arms, telling him to remove them by cutting through his flesh. Diego passes the test. Meanwhile, Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda Young kidnaps Cecilia, Mateo, Valentina, and Gabriela. They wake up in the clinic, now subjects of John's Jigsaw games.
>
> Valentina is tasked with severing her leg with a Gigli saw and extracting enough bone marrow to release a key to free herself. She successfully amputates her leg but is unable to collect enough marrow, and a second Gigli saw decapitates her. Cecilia uses Valentina's intestines as a rope to retrieve her phone and call for help, but Amanda shocks her into submission and confiscates the phone.
>
> Parker breaks into the clinic, demanding his money back. Amanda restrains him while Mateo is forced to drill into his own skull and remove a piece of cerebral tissue to dissolve in a test tube and obtain a key. Although he successfully performs the task, the tissue fails to dissolve in time, and a heated mask closes over his face, killing him. Next, Gabriela is suspended from shackles and subjected to ionizing radiation, tasked with freeing herself by using a sledgehammer to break her shackled limbs.

He attends a cancer support group meeting and befriends Henry Kessler, who later claims he has been cured by an experimental Norwegian cancer treatment conducted by a group led by Dr. Finn Pederson. A desperate John contacts the doctor's daughter Cecilia, who refers him to her clinic outside Mexico City.
>
> On arrival in Mexico, John is driven to the clinic and introduced to Cecilia and her team—Mateo, Valentina, and Dr. Cortez—as well as patients Gabriela and Parker and the caretaker's young son Carlos, with whom he bonds. John goes under for surgery and awakens to Cecilia telling him that he is now cancer-free. Finding a new lease on life, he purchases a gift for Gabriela; however, upon returning to the clinic, he finds it abandoned, a video simulating his supposed brain surgery and no scar on his head, realizing the entire operation was a scam.
>
> Deducing that "Dr. Cortez" was his taxi driver Diego in disguise, John kidnaps and interrogates him, before forcing him to play one of his "games", with pipe bombs wired into his arms, telling him to remove them by cutting through his flesh. Diego passes the test. Meanwhile, Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda Young kidnaps Cecilia, Mateo, Valentina, and Gabriela. They wake up in the clinic, now subjects of John's Jigsaw games.
>
> Valentina is tasked with severing her leg with a Gigli saw and extracting enough bone marrow to release a key to free herself. She successfully amputates her leg but is unable to collect enough marrow, and a second Gigli saw decapitates her. Cecilia uses Valentina's intestines as a rope to retrieve her phone and call for help, but Amanda shocks her into submission and confiscates the phone.
>
> Parker breaks into the clinic, demanding his money back. Amanda restrains him while Mateo is forced to drill into his own skull and remove a piece of cerebral tissue to dissolve in a test tube and obtain a key. Although he successfully performs the task, the tissue fails to dissolve in time, and a heated mask closes over his face, killing him. Next, Gabriela is suspended from shackles and subjected to ionizing radiation, tasked with freeing herself by using a sledgehammer to break her shackled limbs. She succeeds, but before Amanda can take her to a hospital, Parker forces them at gunpoint to release Cecilia.
>
> Cecilia kills Gabriela by breaking her neck and reveals she called Parker, who is part of the scam, to rescue her. She forces John to chain himself into the trap meant for her; when she hears Carlos outside, she takes the child and chains him opposite John. The trap begins to waterboard them with blood. Parker and Cecilia leave to retrieve their bag of stolen cash from John's control room but activate a tripwire, sealing them both in the room and freeing John and Carlos. John reveals Diego outed all of the scammers—including Parker and Henry—and that he tricked Cecilia into luring Parker to the facility. A deadly chemical gas begins filling the room, with the only respite a ventilation hole large enough for one person's head, forcing Cecilia and Parker to fight each other. Cecilia kills Parker but can only watch as John, Amanda, and Carlos exit the facility, leaving her trapped inside.
>
> Sometime later, Henry awakens in a dilapidated bathroom with a new trap strapped to his stomach, overseen by John and Mark Hoffman.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Kendall arrives at Waystar for his first day as co-CEO with Roman. The company learns GoJo wants Waystar's entire executive team to attend their annual corporate retreat in Norway to assess their "cultural fit", which the old guard takes as a sign that Matsson is indeed interested in going through with the acquisition; however, the siblings see it as an affront given the recent death of their father. The Roys' price minimum is $144 per share.
>
> In Norway, however, Matsson surprises Kendall and Roman with an offer of $187 per share for Waystar's whole operation—including ATN, which was not part of the original terms. Kendall and Roman are uncomfortable selling their father's prized possession while the senior team is eager to push the sale through for the increased price. Shiv also informs her brothers that ATN is colluding with Jeryd Mencken's presidential campaign; she is content to give ATN up due to the network's right-wing politics and the potential scandal that would arise if news of the collusion was leaked.
>
> Later in the day, the two sides sit down together over a meal. Tom and Greg attempt to gain favor with the GoJo team, while the other Waystar executives - particularly Hugo - take antagonistic approaches to their counterparts. The siblings attempt to renegotiate the terms of the deal with Matsson so they can keep ATN, arguing that he fundamentally misunderstands its value, but Matsson refuses to budge. Roman eventually agrees to pass on his offer to the board, but that night, Kendall tells Roman he wants to torpedo the entire deal so the two of them can continue running Waystar. Roman is initially apprehensive defying his father's dying wish, but eventually agrees; neither of them inform Shiv. They agree that Matsson must be manipulated into backing out of the deal himself since either of them calling it off would violate their fiduciary duty to shareholders and consequently get them fired by the board. Kendall later tasks Greg with leaking to the press that Waystar and GoJo's teams are not getting along, hoping to place pressure on Matsson to back out of an acquisition.
>
> Shiv, meanwhile, meets privately with Matsson, who reveals that he was romantically involved with Ebba, his head of PR, but that after the relationship soured, he repeatedly sent her half a liter of his own frozen blood. Shiv, both disturbed and amused, advises him on how to avoid a public scandal and recommends him to Gerri. Matsson tells Shiv he enjoys her company and that she reminds him of Logan.
>
> The next morning, Kendall and Roman ride a cable car to meet Matsson atop a mountain; Roman is unsettled when Connor, who is planning Logan's funeral, sends him an image of Logan's corpse. On the mountain, Matsson, who has deduced the brothers' attempts to botch the deal, confronts them, calling them incompetent compared to their father and threatening to bypass them by going directly to Waystar's senior brass to see the deal through. Roman snaps and berates Matsson for summoning them to the retreat mere days after Logan's death, and openly calls off the deal. Matsson, however, is amused, claiming Roman has played into his hands.
>
> On the return flight, the company learns Matsson has made a new offer of $192 per share; Matsson delivers the offer through Frank and refuses to speak directly with Roman and Kendall. The senior executives are elated and immediately pass the offer on to the board. They applaud Kendall and Roman, unaware they were actually trying to ruin the deal. However, they learn that Matsson plans to retain most of his own executive team rather than Waystar's, with only Tom, Gerri, and Karolina getting to keep their jobs. Matsson calls Shiv and asks her to send him a photo of her brothers' dismayed faces. Shiv then tasks Tom with firing Cyd for conspiring with Mencken's campaign and invites him to dinner upon their return home.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Kendall arrives at Waystar for his first day as co-CEO with Roman. The company learns GoJo wants Waystar's entire executive team to attend their annual corporate retreat in Norway to assess their "cultural fit", which the old guard takes as a sign that Matsson is indeed interested in going through with the acquisition; however, the siblings see it as an affront given the recent death of their father. The Roys' price minimum is $144 per share.
>
> In Norway, however, Matsson surprises Kendall and Roman with an offer of $187 per share for Waystar's whole operation—including ATN, which was not part of the original terms. Kendall and Roman are uncomfortable selling their father's prized possession while the senior team is eager to push the sale through for the increased price. Shiv also informs her brothers that ATN is colluding with Jeryd Mencken's presidential campaign; she is content to give ATN up due to the network's right-wing politics and the potential scandal that would arise if news of the collusion was leaked.
>
> Later in the day, the two sides sit down together over a meal. Tom and Greg attempt to gain favor with the GoJo team, while the other Waystar executives - particularly Hugo - take antagonistic approaches to their counterparts. The siblings attempt to renegotiate the terms of the deal with Matsson so they can keep ATN, arguing that he fundamentally misunderstands its value, but Matsson refuses to budge. Roman eventually agrees to pass on his offer to the board, but that night, Kendall tells Roman he wants to torpedo the entire deal so the two of them can continue running Waystar. Roman is initially apprehensive defying his father's dying wish, but eventually agrees; neither of them inform Shiv. They agree that Matsson must be manipulated into backing out of the deal himself since either of them calling it off would violate their fiduciary duty to shareholders and consequently get them fired by the board. Kendall later tasks Greg with leaking to the press that Waystar and GoJo's teams are not getting along, hoping to place pressure on Matsson to back out of an acquisition.

Shiv, both disturbed and amused, advises him on how to avoid a public scandal and recommends him to Gerri. Matsson tells Shiv he enjoys her company and that she reminds him of Logan.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Kendall arrives at Waystar for his first day as co-CEO with Roman. The company learns GoJo wants Waystar's entire executive team to attend their annual corporate retreat in Norway to assess their "cultural fit", which the old guard takes as a sign that Matsson is indeed interested in going through with the acquisition; however, the siblings see it as an affront given the recent death of their father. The Roys' price minimum is $144 per share.
>
> In Norway, however, Matsson surprises Kendall and Roman with an offer of $187 per share for Waystar's whole operation—including ATN, which was not part of the original terms. Kendall and Roman are uncomfortable selling their father's prized possession while the senior team is eager to push the sale through for the increased price. Shiv also informs her brothers that ATN is colluding with Jeryd Mencken's presidential campaign; she is content to give ATN up due to the network's right-wing politics and the potential scandal that would arise if news of the collusion was leaked.
>
> Later in the day, the two sides sit down together over a meal. Tom and Greg attempt to gain favor with the GoJo team, while the other Waystar executives - particularly Hugo - take antagonistic approaches to their counterparts. The siblings attempt to renegotiate the terms of the deal with Matsson so they can keep ATN, arguing that he fundamentally misunderstands its value, but Matsson refuses to budge. Roman eventually agrees to pass on his offer to the board, but that night, Kendall tells Roman he wants to torpedo the entire deal so the two of them can continue running Waystar. Roman is initially apprehensive defying his father's dying wish, but eventually agrees; neither of them inform Shiv. They agree that Matsson must be manipulated into backing out of the deal himself since either of them calling it off would violate their fiduciary duty to shareholders and consequently get them fired by the board. Kendall later tasks Greg with leaking to the press that Waystar and GoJo's teams are not getting along, hoping to place pressure on Matsson to back out of an acquisition.
>
> Shiv, meanwhile, meets privately with Matsson, who reveals that he was romantically involved with Ebba, his head of PR, but that after the relationship soured, he repeatedly sent her half a liter of his own frozen blood. Shiv, both disturbed and amused, advises him on how to avoid a public scandal and recommends him to Gerri. Matsson tells Shiv he enjoys her company and that she reminds him of Logan.
>
> The next morning, Kendall and Roman ride a cable car to meet Matsson atop a mountain; Roman is unsettled when Connor, who is planning Logan's funeral, sends him an image of Logan's corpse. On the mountain, Matsson, who has deduced the brothers' attempts to botch the deal, confronts them, calling them incompetent compared to their father and threatening to bypass them by going directly to Waystar's senior brass to see the deal through. Roman snaps and berates Matsson for summoning them to the retreat mere days after Logan's death, and openly calls off the deal. Matsson, however, is amused, claiming Roman has played into his hands.
>
> On the return flight, the company learns Matsson has made a new offer of $192 per share; Matsson delivers the offer through Frank and refuses to speak directly with Roman and Kendall. The senior executives are elated and immediately pass the offer on to the board. They applaud Kendall and Roman, unaware they were actually trying to ruin the deal. However, they learn that Matsson plans to retain most of his own executive team rather than Waystar's, with only Tom, Gerri, and Karolina getting to keep their jobs. Matsson calls Shiv and asks her to send him a photo of her brothers' dismayed faces. Shiv then tasks Tom with firing Cyd for conspiring with Mencken's campaign and invites him to dinner upon their return home.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Carol Danvers destroys the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that leads the Kree empire. This leads to a civil war and the desolation of the Kree home world, Hala, over the next 30 years. The conflict renders the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight.
>
> Dar-Benn, the new leader of the Kree, discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands. She harnesses the power of the Band to tear open a jump point, a gateway that allows fast travel across space. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire jump point network, including a jump point near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. space station that is run by Nick Fury. Captain Monica Rambeau investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new jump point that Dar-Benn opened. When they touch their respective jump points, Rambeau is transported to Danvers' location, Kamala Khan—who has the other Quantum Band on Earth—is transported to Rambeau's location, and Danvers is transported to Kamala's house. The three use their different light-based powers to fight off Kree enemies, leaving the Khan family home destroyed.
>
> After the three women return to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement, and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously.
>
> The three join up at a Skrull refugee colony on the planet Tarnax, which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down, Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala. After a hasty effort to evacuate the colony, Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala form a team that Kamala names "the Marvels". Danvers explains that the Quantum Bands were used to create the jump point transportation network, and Dar-Benn is combining her Quantum Band with the Kree's Universal Weapon. Dar-Benn's repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability to the network and endangering the entire universe. They deduce that Dar-Benn is targeting planets that are meaningful to Danvers, who Dar-Benn blames for the desolation of Hala.
>
> The Marvels reach the water planet Aladna before Dar-Benn does and prepare the local population for an attack. Dar-Benn arrives and tears open a jump point to draw the planet's water to Hala. She almost steals Kamala's Quantum Band, forcing Kamala to flee with Danvers and Rambeau. Dar-Benn's final plan is to use the energy from Earth's sun to restore that of Hala. The Marvels fight and subdue Dar-Benn, but she steals Kamala's Band and uses both bangles to tear open another hole in space. The act destroys Dar-Benn, ends the Marvels' entanglement, and leaves behind a rupture between realities. After Kamala reclaims the Bands, she and Danvers use their combined powers to energize Rambeau, allowing her to close the hole from the other side, stranding her in the process. Kamala returns to Earth and Danvers flies into Hala's sun, using her power to restore it.
>
> The short-lived team-up inspires Kamala to seek out other young heroes and form a new group, starting with Kate Bishop. In a mid-credits scene, Rambeau awakes in a parallel universe where she is greeted by Binary—an alternate version of her mother Maria—and the mutant scientist Hank McCoy.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Carol Danvers destroys the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that leads the Kree empire. This leads to a civil war and the desolation of the Kree home world, Hala, over the next 30 years. The conflict renders the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight.
>
> Dar-Benn, the new leader of the Kree, discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands. She harnesses the power of the Band to tear open a jump point, a gateway that allows fast travel across space. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire jump point network, including a jump point near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. space station that is run by Nick Fury. Captain Monica Rambeau investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new jump point that Dar-Benn opened. When they touch their respective jump points, Rambeau is transported to Danvers' location, Kamala Khan—who has the other Quantum Band on Earth—is transported to Rambeau's location, and Danvers is transported to Kamala's house. The three use their different light-based powers to fight off Kree enemies, leaving the Khan family home destroyed.
>
> After the three women return to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement, and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously.
>
> The three join up at a Skrull refugee colony on the planet Tarnax, which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down, Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala. After a hasty effort to evacuate the colony, Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala form a team that Kamala names "the Marvels". Danvers explains that the Quantum Bands were used to create the jump point transportation network, and Dar-Benn is combining her Quantum Band with the Kree's Universal Weapon. Dar-Benn's repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability to the network and endangering the entire universe. They deduce that Dar-Benn is targeting planets that are meaningful to Danvers, who Dar-Benn blames for the desolation of Hala.
>
> The Marvels reach the water planet Aladna before Dar-Benn does and prepare the local population for an attack. Dar-Benn arrives and tears open a jump point to draw the planet's water to Hala. She almost steals Kamala's Quantum Band, forcing Kamala to flee with Danvers and Rambeau. Dar-Benn's final plan is to use the energy from Earth's sun to restore that of Hala.

Question: What planets are meaningful to Carol?
Answer: Tarnax, Aladna, and Earth are meaningful to Carol.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Carol Danvers destroys the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that leads the Kree empire. This leads to a civil war and the desolation of the Kree home world, Hala, over the next 30 years. The conflict renders the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight.
>
> Dar-Benn, the new leader of the Kree, discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands. She harnesses the power of the Band to tear open a jump point, a gateway that allows fast travel across space. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire jump point network, including a jump point near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. space station that is run by Nick Fury. Captain Monica Rambeau investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new jump point that Dar-Benn opened. When they touch their respective jump points, Rambeau is transported to Danvers' location, Kamala Khan—who has the other Quantum Band on Earth—is transported to Rambeau's location, and Danvers is transported to Kamala's house. The three use their different light-based powers to fight off Kree enemies, leaving the Khan family home destroyed.
>
> After the three women return to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement, and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously.
>
> The three join up at a Skrull refugee colony on the planet Tarnax, which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down, Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala. After a hasty effort to evacuate the colony, Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala form a team that Kamala names "the Marvels". Danvers explains that the Quantum Bands were used to create the jump point transportation network, and Dar-Benn is combining her Quantum Band with the Kree's Universal Weapon. Dar-Benn's repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability to the network and endangering the entire universe. They deduce that Dar-Benn is targeting planets that are meaningful to Danvers, who Dar-Benn blames for the desolation of Hala.

Answer a question using the following story:

> Sean announces his intent to run as a comptroller in Staten Island. As he is tracking poorly with the gay demographic, Sean decides to host a pride parade. He asks the vampires for help, with Laszlo promising to help.
>
> Guillermo confides to Laszlo that his bat wings have started to appear in his back. When Colin Robinson talks about some vampiric traits, Laszlo and Nandor question his claims. They decide to test the myths, such as vampires counting rice, an increased jump on their third flight, and flying to outer space. Nadja discovers that Nadja's Ghost laments remaining a virgin, as her spirit was captured before she was turned into a vampire. To make up for accidentally breaking her legs, Nadja accepts in body swapping with her so she can finally have sex. Nadja's Ghost goes to a bar in an attempt to speed date, but is unsuccessful in finding a person.
>
> Guillermo is still resistant to light exposure, surprising Laszlo. Laszlo uses Guillermo's sweat in his skin, which surprisingly allows him to go outside during the day. Nadja's Ghost refuses to leave her body, so Colin Robinson suggests inserting himself into Nadja's body to reclaim it, which leads to a fight during the parade, but they eventually start singing "It's Raining Men", which is well received by the audience. During this, Nandor tests flying to outer space, eventually reaching it. However, he begins falling back to Earth, crashing into the parade as a fireball. Despite that, the parade proves to be a success. Later, Guillermo and Nandor stumble into a room, in which Nadja (still inside the doll) and Laszlo have sex with Nadja's Ghost and Colin Robinson.
