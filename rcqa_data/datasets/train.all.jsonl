The AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert to retrieve one-half of the key from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, who carries a bounty from an unknown source. Ethan retrieves the half-key and fakes Ilsa's death. Back in Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger to discuss the rogue AI. Director Eugene Kittridge recounts how the \"Entity\" has achieved sentience and can manipulate major defense intelligence and financial networks of the world at will. World powers compete to obtain the key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.\n>\n> Revealing himself and exposing Kittridge's bounty on Ilsa, Ethan states his intention to destroy the Entity. Ethan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other half-key despite knowing they will be racing against all world powers. Ethan evades US agents in pursuit of the holder, but the half-key is stolen by a professional thief named Grace. Concurrently, Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device. Ethan suspects foul play after seeing Gabriel, a sadistic Entity liaison with ties to Ethan's pre-IMF past. Aborting the mission, the team scatters and Grace escapes to Rome.

Ethan unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale, allowing Gabriel and Grace to walk free. Ethan pursues Grace, but the Entity impersonates Benji and leads him into a fight with Paris, whom he subdues and spares. Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Ethan. A remorseful Grace agrees to impersonate Alanna and take back the key during the sale. Luther leaves for an off-grid location to investigate the traces of the Entity in his hard drive, reminding Ethan to spare Gabriel for information despite his declaration of vengeance for Ilsa's death.

Kendall and Roman are uncomfortable selling their father's prized possession while the senior team is eager to push the sale through for the increased price. Shiv also informs her brothers that ATN is colluding with Jeryd Mencken's presidential campaign; she is content to give ATN up due to the network's right-wing politics and the potential scandal that would arise if news of the collusion was leaked.\n>\n> Later in the day, the two sides sit down together over a meal. Tom and Greg attempt to gain favor with the GoJo team, while the other Waystar executives - particularly Hugo - take antagonistic approaches to their counterparts. The siblings attempt to renegotiate the terms of the deal with Matsson so they can keep ATN, arguing that he fundamentally misunderstands its value, but Matsson refuses to budge. Roman eventually agrees to pass on his offer to the board, but that night, Kendall tells Roman he wants to torpedo the entire deal so the two of them can continue running Waystar. Roman is initially apprehensive defying his father's dying wish, but eventually agrees; neither of them inform Shiv. They agree that Matsson must be manipulated into backing out of the deal himself since either of them calling it off would violate their fiduciary duty to shareholders and consequently get them fired by the board.

Shiv, both disturbed and amused, advises him on how to avoid a public scandal and recommends him to Gerri. Matsson tells Shiv he enjoys her company and that she reminds him of Logan.\n>\n> The next morning, Kendall and Roman ride a cable car to meet Matsson atop a mountain; Roman is unsettled when Connor, who is planning Logan's funeral, sends him an image of Logan's corpse. On the mountain, Matsson, who has deduced the brothers' attempts to botch the deal, confronts them, calling them incompetent compared to their father and threatening to bypass them by going directly to Waystar's senior brass to see the deal through. Roman snaps and berates Matsson for summoning them to the retreat mere days after Logan's death, and openly calls off the deal. Matsson, however, is amused, claiming Roman has played into his hands.\n>\n> On the return flight, the company learns Matsson has made a new offer of $192 per share; Matsson delivers the offer through Frank and refuses to speak directly with Roman and Kendall.

Roman eventually agrees to pass on his offer to the board, but that night, Kendall tells Roman he wants to torpedo the entire deal so the two of them can continue running Waystar. Roman is initially apprehensive defying his father's dying wish, but eventually agrees; neither of them inform Shiv.

Shiv, both disturbed and amused, advises him on how to avoid a public scandal and recommends him to Gerri. Matsson tells Shiv he enjoys her company and that she reminds him of Logan.\n>\n> The next morning, Kendall and Roman ride a cable car to meet Matsson atop a mountain; Roman is unsettled when Connor, who is planning Logan's funeral, sends him an image of Logan's corpse. On the mountain, Matsson, who has deduced the brothers' attempts to botch the deal, confronts them, calling them incompetent compared to their father and threatening to bypass them by going directly to Waystar's senior brass to see the deal through.

The company learns GoJo wants Waystar's entire executive team to attend their annual corporate retreat in Norway to assess their \"cultural fit\", which the old guard takes as a sign that Matsson is indeed interested in going through with the acquisition; however, the siblings see it as an affront given the recent death of their father. The Roys' price minimum is $144 per share.\n>\n> In Norway, however, Matsson surprises Kendall and Roman with an offer of $187 per share for Waystar's whole operation—including ATN, which was not part of the original terms. Kendall and Roman are uncomfortable selling their father's prized possession while the senior team is eager to push the sale through for the increased price. Shiv also informs her brothers that ATN is colluding with Jeryd Mencken's presidential campaign; she is content to give ATN up due to the network's right-wing politics and the potential scandal that would arise if news of the collusion was leaked.\n>\n> Later in the day, the two sides sit down together over a meal. Tom and Greg attempt to gain favor with the GoJo team, while the other Waystar executives - particularly Hugo - take antagonistic approaches to their counterparts. The siblings attempt to renegotiate the terms of the deal with Matsson so they can keep ATN, arguing that he fundamentally misunderstands its value, but Matsson refuses to budge. Roman eventually agrees to pass on his offer to the board, but that night, Kendall tells Roman he wants to torpedo the entire deal so the two of them can continue running Waystar. Roman is initially apprehensive defying his father's dying wish, but eventually agrees; neither of them inform Shiv. They agree that Matsson must be manipulated into backing out of the deal himself since either of them calling it off would violate their fiduciary duty to shareholders and consequently get them fired by the board. Kendall later tasks Greg with leaking to the press that Waystar and GoJo's teams are not getting along, hoping to place pressure on Matsson to back out of an acquisition.\n>\n> Shiv, meanwhile, meets privately with Matsson, who reveals that he was romantically involved with Ebba, his head of PR, but that after the relationship soured, he repeatedly sent her half a liter of his own frozen blood. Shiv, both disturbed and amused, advises him on how to avoid a public scandal and recommends him to Gerri. Matsson tells Shiv he enjoys her company and that she reminds him of Logan.\n>\n> The next morning, Kendall and Roman ride a cable car to meet Matsson atop a mountain; Roman is unsettled when Connor, who is planning Logan's funeral, sends him an image of Logan's corpse. On the mountain, Matsson, who has deduced the brothers' attempts to botch the deal, confronts them, calling them incompetent compared to their father and threatening to bypass them by going directly to Waystar's senior brass to see the deal through. Roman snaps and berates Matsson for summoning them to the retreat mere days after Logan's death, and openly calls off the deal. Matsson, however, is amused, claiming Roman has played into his hands.\n>\n> On the return flight, the company learns Matsson has made a new offer of $192 per share; Matsson delivers the offer through Frank and refuses to speak directly with Roman and Kendall.
