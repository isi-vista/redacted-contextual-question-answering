  "summary": "Dee asks Dennis for money, despite not working through the day. When the Gang questions her about her motives, she finally reveals that she is going out bowling with some friends of hers. After she leaves, the rest of the Gang declares they would not waste their time going bowling.\n\nAt the bowling alley, Dee meets with her team, which consists of The Waitress, Artemis, and Gail the Snail. They did not want Dee on their team, but their fourth required member dropped out. Suddenly, Charlie, Dennis, Mac, and Frank arrive, intending to fend off the girls in a girls vs boys league. They visit the alley owners, which are revealed to be Liam and Ryan McPoyle, who bought the place after a financial turmoil. After paying a fee, they allow them to play in the league.\n\nThe first round starts with the boys all achieving strikes, while the girls struggle in competing. After Dennis mocks the girls, Dee decides to employ a new strategy, which will involve manipulating the boys for their stupidity. This gets them to almost match their score in the following rounds. When Dennis mocks Dee again, The Waitress challenges him to an arcade game to prove his test of strength by punching a ball. The Waitress delivers a kick that gives her points, but Dennis' punch hits the limit of the score, earning him the win. However, the punch was strong enough to break his bones and cannot bowl on the final game against Dee. He convinces Liam to bowl for him, while Dee gets Ryan to bowl for her team. During his turn, Liam cannot see the pins due to his blurred vision and accidentally hits Ryan's hand with a ball, causing both to drop out and Dennis and Dee having to play. Dee finally overcomes her mockery and manages to strike one pin, winning. However, she notes that everyone left and The Waitress admits she is not interested in their win as she doesn't care about women's sports.",
